# RFM
RFM analysis is a technique that segments customers based on three metrics: recency, frequency, and monetary value. Recency measures how recently a customer made a purchase, frequency measures how often a customer made a purchase, and monetary value measures how much a customer spent. By assigning scores to each metric and combining them, RFM analysis can rank customers into different segments, such as loyal, high-value, at-risk, etc. RFM analysis can help optimize marketing campaigns, increase customer loyalty, and improve customer lifetime value.
